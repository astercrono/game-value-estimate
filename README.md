# Game Value Estimate

A simple web page that estimates how many hours you put into a game. The goal is to determine whether a game was worth the price that you paid for it. 

In addition to the number of hours that you put into a game, there are two other factors that are taken into consideration:
 - Genre (Category): Different genres have a different value per hour. For example, single player games that are primarily story driven are typically shorter games, yet are still valued quite high. On the other hand, MMO-type games are specifically built to have a huge number of hours dumped into them.
 - Rating: Sometimes, even though a game was short, you enjoyed it enough that you still feel like it was a justified purchase.

The metrics most certainly could use some adjustment. The calculation is not meant to be a definitive answer, but rather be a helpful tool in the question of whether a game was indeed worth the price you paid for it.
